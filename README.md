## 📖 Project Overview

### Business Problem
**Goal:** Predict customers who will not make a purchase in the next 90 days.
* **Context:** Customer acquisition costs are **5-25x higher** than retention.
* **Impact:** Reducing churn by **15-20%** can significantly increase customer lifetime value (LTV).
* **Success Metric:** ROC-AUC > 0.75 on the test set.

### Methodology & Results
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed cancellations, and filtered outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created 30+ features including RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores and purchase velocity.
3. **Model Selection:** Evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Final Model:** **XGBoost Classifier** achieved the highest performance with an **ROC-AUC of 0.7812**.
